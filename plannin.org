* Focusing Questions
** Who is the audience?
** What do they hope to learn?

* Possible (sub)topics
- ES plugin
  - why we needed it, what it does
  - performance (would have to come after other work)
- Pseudolabeling
- Annotation
- Automatic measurement
  - This has some dependencies on the others probably
* Es plugin outline
** Why we needed it
*** Our desire for a machine learned model
*** Limitations with custom scoring scripts
** What it does
*** Featurize matching documents
*** Also return feature vectors in explain
* Funny notes:
- we did the last resort first
